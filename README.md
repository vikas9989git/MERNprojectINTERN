# Product Info Editable Application with Authentication

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to manage product information, including editing and updating product details. The application features secure login and signup authentication.


1. **User Authentication**: The application provides user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and route protection. Only authenticated users can access the product management features.

2. **Product Information Management**: Users can view, edit, and update product details via a user-friendly interface. This includes changing product names, prices, descriptions, and other relevant details.

3. **MongoDB as Database**: Product information and user data are stored in MongoDB, providing a scalable and flexible database solution. Mongoose is used for schema validation and database interactions.

4. **Frontend with React**: The frontend is built with React, offering a dynamic and responsive user experience. The product list and editing forms are integrated seamlessly with the backend API.

5. **Backend API with Express & Node.js**: The backend API is developed using Express.js and Node.js, handling authentication, product operations (CRUD), and secure communication between the frontend and database.
